Visualize the human trafficking issues based on police-reported data from StatCan website

## Project Description:
- Dashboard providing an overview of the human trafficking issue in Canada from 2011 to 2021.
- I used Python and MS Power BI to build this dashboard.

## Dataset:
- The dataset: downloaded from the Statistics Canada website. [Link](https://www150.statcan.gc.ca/t1/tbl1/en/tv.action?pid=3510017701&pickMembers%5B0%5D=1.1&pickMembers%5B1%5D=2.58&cubeTimeFrame.startYear=2017&cubeTimeFrame.endYear=2021&referencePeriods=20170101%2C20210101).
- There are 2 methods to download the datasets from StatCan websites: using Python and using StatCan web interface.
- After downloading the dataset, I used Python for cleaning and wrangling data.
- The cleaned dataset was loaded to Power BI for visualization.
