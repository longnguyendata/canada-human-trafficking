## Project Description
- My goal is to design a set of dashboards that provide a clear and concise overview of human trafficking in Canada.
- I want to make the dashboards user-friendly and interactive, allowing users to easily navigate through the data.

## Dataset
- The dataset can be downloaded from the [Statistics Canada website](https://www150.statcan.gc.ca/t1/tbl1/en/tv.action?pid=3510017701&pickMembers%5B0%5D=1.1&pickMembers%5B1%5D=2.58&cubeTimeFrame.startYear=2017&cubeTimeFrame.endYear=2021&referencePeriods=20170101%2C20210101).
- After downloading the dataset, I used Python for cleaning and wrangling data. With its robust libraries such as Pandas and Numpy, Python is a powerful tool for data manipulation, preprocessing, and analysis.
- The cleaned dataset was loaded to Power BI for visualization.

## Desired Insights
- Which provinces have the highest human trafficking incidents from 2011 to 2021? In each year?
- What does the trend of human trafficking incidents over the period in each province look like?
- Compare the crime statistics between 2 provinces, e.g. Alberta vs. Ontario.
- What are the forecast incidents in Canada in the next 5 years?

## Skills Used
### Python
- Data Cleaning
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Data Manipulation

### Power BI
